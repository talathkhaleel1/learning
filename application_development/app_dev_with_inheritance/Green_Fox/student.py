# Create a Student class that has the same fields and methods as the Person class, and has the following additional
#
# fields:
# previous_organization: the name of the studentâ€™s previous company / school
# skipped_days: the number of days skipped from the course
# methods:
# get_goal(): prints out "Be a junior software developer."
# introduce(): "Hi, I'm name, a age year old gender from previous_organization who skipped skipped_days days from the course already."
# skip_days(number_of_days): increases skipped_days by number_of_days
# The Student class has the following constructors:
#
# Student(name, age, gender, previous_organization): beside the given parameters, it sets skipped_days to 0
# Student(): sets name to Jane Doe, age to 30, gender to female, previous_organization to The School of Life, skipped_days to 0
