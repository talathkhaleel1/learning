        <h4>About Chip and Dale</h4>
        <p>
            Chip and Dale (also spelled Chip 'n' Dale or Chip an' Dale) are <strong> duo of cartoon characters<br>
            created in 1943 by The Walt Disney Company.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            As anthropomorphic chipmunk brothers,[2] their names are a pun on the name of the <br>
            18th-century cabinet maker and furniture designer Thomas Chippendale. <br>
            This was <em>suggested by Bill "Tex" Henson, a story artist at the studio.</em><br>
            The characters were first <em>introduced in the 1943 </em>Pluto short Private Pluto, <br>
            directed by Clyde Geronimi, in which they fight with Pluto about whether they <br>
            can store their nuts in a military base cannon.
