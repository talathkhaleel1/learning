    <h1>Unicorn - The Mythical Creature</h1>

        <h5>About the Character</h5>
        <p>The unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since antiquity as <strong>a beast<br>
            with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In European literature and art, the unicorn has for the last thousand years or so <br>
            depicted as a white horse-like or goat-like animal with a long straight horn with <br>
            grooves, cloven hooves, and sometimes a goat's beard. In the<em> Middle Ages and <br>
            Renaissance</em>,it was commonly described as an extremely wild woodland creature, <br>
            <em>a symbol of purity and grace,</em> which could be captured only by a virgin. <br>
            In the encyclopedias, its horn was said to have the power to render poisoned water potable<br>
            and to heal sickness. In medieval and Renaissance times, the tusk of the narwhal was <br>
            sometimes sold as a unicorn horn.<br>
